# Motor-controller-with-Regenerative-braking

This repository consists of an arduino commutated motor controller for BLDC motor control

Tested successfully for 24 V application using ME0913 BLDC 24 pole motor on no load.

This controller employs speed control of BLDC motor along with Regenerative braking 

The inverter configuration was implemented using IR2110D mosfet gate driver and IRFP460 power mosfets along with isolation.

The setup also facilitates control using Atmega16 microcontroller
